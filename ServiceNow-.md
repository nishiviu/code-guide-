* 1.1 **Readability:** Remember. other may work with your code in the future. Ensure your code is easy to read and understand. 
* 1.2. **Comment your code:** What may seem obvious now, may not be clear later. Comments should be clear, well written and short. Unusual code snippets should always be commented along with some reasoning (for example: settimeouts, hacks).
* 1.3. **Do not modify / delete built in ServiceNow code:** Try to understand and respect the vision behind the built in code. Try to find a standard solution for your problem. It's highly improbable you need to modify / delete built in code snippets to achieve what you actually need.
* 1.4. **Use descriptive variable and function names**
* 1.5. **Use variables to store function results**
