* 1.1 **Readability:** Remember. other may work with your code in the future. Ensure your code is easy to read and understand. 
* 1.2. **Comment your code:** What may seem obvious now, may not be clear later. Comments should be clear, well written and short. Unusual code snippets should always be commented along with some reasoning (for example: settimeouts, hacks).
* 1.3. **Do not change / delete built in ServiceNow code:** Unless you safely know what are you doing. It's highly improbable you need to do so to achieve what you actually need.
